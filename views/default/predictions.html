<h4>Manually add results folders </h4>
<p>Results folders are added to the database whenever a set of predictions is submitted via the
web interface. Therefore this menu is normally used to delete old predictions.
However you can also manually add predictions here so that they appear in the drop down menus.
<i>Results added should exist on the filesystem</i>

<h5>Current folders</h5>
