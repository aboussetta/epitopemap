<p>Results labels (identifier) are added to the database whenever a set of predictions is submitted via the
web interface. These are used to separate sets of predictions into groups e.g. for different users etc.
or for separate studies.
The database simply keeps track of these labels so they can populate the forms. If there is
a result identifier present in the results listed on the left not in the db you can add it here.
Results labels should exist on the filesystem (i.e. should be in the left table).
