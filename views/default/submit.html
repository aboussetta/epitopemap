<h5>Tips</h5>
<p>
The usual method is to select one or more predictors and appropriate alleles which are
then run at once for all the proteins in the chosen genome. For an entire proteome
using multiple methods, it could take hours to process. Tepitope is fastest so
if you want a quick result just pick this method.
<u> Selection of alleles should always be tailored to your needs</u> or the results
will not be meaningful. Don't just select all alleles in the list as there is a limit of
30 alleles to prevent overloading the server. Some alleles are not available for all methods
and will be ignored for those methods. DP and DQ alleles are netMHCIIpan only.
{{=A('The Allele Frequency Net Database', _href='http://www.allelefrequencies.net/')}}
may be useful for human allele selections.

<br>
If the genome is not in the drop down list you should go to the
{{=A('add genome', _href=URL(r=request,f='genomes'))}}
page and add it to the database so that the application is aware of it's availability.
