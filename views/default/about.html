Certain pathogenic bacteria and protozoan parasites survive ingestion by macrophages and
replicate inside the intracellular vesicles of the endosomalâ€“lysosomal system. These bacteria
and their toxic products can be broken down by digestive enzymes and their peptides delivered
to be bound by MHC class II molecules. These molecules are then brought to the surface of the Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) and presented to T cell receptors along with the co-receptor molecule CD4. If the epitope is antigenic it may activate the T cells and elicit an immune response.
By efficiently endocytosing specific antigen via their surface immunoglobulin and presenting
the antigen-derived peptides on MHC class II molecules, B cells can activate CD4 T cells that
will in turn serve as helper T cells for the production of antibodies against that antigen.<p>
The generation of peptides from native proteins is commonly referred to as antigen processing.
The antigen presentation pathway is fundamental to the cellular adaptive immune reponse.

Accurate prediction of the peptides that will form antigenic epitopes is essential to
rational vaccine design. Such prediction is largely done by estimating the binding affinity
of the peptide to the MHC-II molecule. This is determined by the binding core region of the ligand.
Peptide binding will often be allele restricted or promiscuous and bind to multiple alleles.
Methods such as TEPITOPE and NetMHCIIpan rely on determining the polymorphic pockets of
the MHC binding groove, almost entirely located on the beta-chain. The particular amino acids
in the binding pockets determine the peptide specificity of that allele.
