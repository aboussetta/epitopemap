A web application for visualizing mhc binding predictions

#### Background

This web2py application is designed to allow binding predictions to be run for multiple proteins, such as a whole bacterial genome. 

#### Installation

Simply clone the git repository and add the folder into your Python path.

#### Usage

#### Background

This repository is a collection of Python modules partly designed to be used in conjunction with miRDeep2. This is a program for analysis of small RNA sequencing data. These scripts were used for all analysis in our paper. [reference]. The code is deposited here primarily to allow our work to be replicated. However the modules may prove useful to other miRDeep users.

#### Installation

Install web2py and then clone the git repository into the applications folder.
